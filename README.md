## Description

In this repository I implemented with JPA a model for resolving the requested problem.

## Features

  - (Compulsory) Created persistence unit "MusicAlbumsPU"
  - (Compulsory) Implemented the classes Album, Artist, AlbumRepository, ArtistRepository, PersistenceUtil with all functionalities
  - (Compulsory) Created the AlbumManager class which contains the main function
  - (Optional)   Created class chart which implements finding album by genre and can order them by release year
  - (Optional)   Created the abstract class for repositories, AlbumRepository and ArtistRepository extend this class
  - (Bonus)      Implemented the problem of finding the maximal subset of albums such that no two albums have the same genre or artist name, I added a tutorial for my solution in JavaDoc
  - (Bonus)      Chart class is able to find albums by genres
 
## Not resolved

  - (Optional) JDBC implementation apart from JPA implementation
  - (Bonus)    Generating fake names with third party library
